    <h3>How to insert images into webpage</h3>
    <strong><u>Images hosted on servers</u></strong>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Use HTML element "img"</li>
      <li>Insert element attribute "src"</li>
      <li>right click on the image that you want to appear on the browser and
        copy image address</li>
      <li>paste image address after =</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you wish to upload your own photo, you can use an application /
      service provider like photobucket.
      <br>
      If the server is taken down or the image is moved / deleted in the server,
      the image will no longer show up on your webpage
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong><u>Images hosted locally on same folder as project</u></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Use HTML element "img"</li>
      <li>Insert element attribute "src"</li>
      <li>upload photo into project file</li>
      <li>insert name of photo or path of photo after =</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the image is in the same hierachical level as the webpage, you only
      need to key in the name of the image as shown in this application. If not,
      you will have to add a path for the image by putting the folder name
      followed by "/".</p>
